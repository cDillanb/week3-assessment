The internet is like a very, very big network of computers from all over the world.
It's a way for people to connect and communicate or share info to one another.
Basically a bunch of computers plugged into eachother but on a huge scale, and without wires.
If you wanted to send a message to send a message to someone, the message would go to your
router. which would "route" it to that someone's computer.

When you click on a link, you are sending a request to find the ip of that url. The browser begins searchng
for that ip address to get you to the site. It first looks in your local cache, then your local router, then your ISP,
then finally if all else fails it looks in the root servers on the Internet. Whenever it finds the ip address linked with
the url, it well send it back to you and make a request to that ip to go to that site.
